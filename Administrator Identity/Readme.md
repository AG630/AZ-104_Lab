# Creating a group containing members in

The first task is to create a group, assign members to that group - sounds easy enough. The first thing is to go to Microsoft Entra ID in the tenant:
(the email I used was something completely random, because my other accounts I set up were linked to one that I had already used the free trial for Azure)

Expanding the manage tab on the left will present a list of options - fortunately the group tab is very easy to see and select. I've also favourited it for convienience:

Select New group:

And parse all the required fields, I've created a group called Nsync for humerous reasons which makes things easier to remember too

And I've also created a user, Justin Timberlake in my instance:

And then assigned Justin Timberlake to the Nsync group:
